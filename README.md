# CodeAlpha_Unemployment_Analysis-with-Python
📊 Unemployment Analysis in India Using Python

This project analyzes unemployment trends across different regions of India using a real dataset. The analysis covers the time before, during, and after the COVID-19 pandemic to highlight key patterns and insights that can inform policy and economic strategies.

 📁 Dataset

- **File:** `Unemployment in India.csv`
- **Source:** Contains monthly unemployment statistics by region and area (rural/urban).
- **Columns Include:**
  - Date
  - Region
  - Area
  - Estimated Unemployment Rate (%)
  - Estimated Employed
  - Estimated Labour Participation Rate
  - Frequency

🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

- Standardized column names by removing spaces and special characters.
- Converted `Date` column to datetime format.
- Extracted `Month`, `Month Name`, and `Year` for time-based analysis.
- Converted `Region`, `Area`, and `Frequency` to categorical types.
- Imputed missing values using:
  - **Mean** for numeric columns
  - **Mode** for categorical columns

 📈 Data Exploration & Visualization
 ✅ Overall Unemployment Trend
- Line plot shows fluctuations in unemployment over time.

 ✅ COVID-19 Impact
- Focused on **March–June 2020** to visualize the immediate economic effects.
- Plotted unemployment rate across regions during the pandemic onset.

 ✅ Regional Unemployment Analysis
- Bar plot of average unemployment by region to expose geographical disparities.

 ✅ Seasonal Trends
